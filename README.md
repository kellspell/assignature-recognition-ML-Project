## Part 1 — Model Training Notebook

**File:** `notebooks/Signature-Recognition.ipynb`

### Dataset

Located at `notebooks/dataset/`. Organized into two sub-folders that `ImageFolder` uses as class labels:

```
dataset/
├── Forged/       # forged signature images
└── Original/     # genuine signature images
```

| Split | Count |
|---|---|
| Total | 842 |
| Train (60%) | 505 |
| Validation (30%) | 252 |
| Test (10%) | 85 |

Classes are loaded via `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder`, which maps folder names to integer indices:

```
['Forged', 'Original']  →  [0, 1]
```

---

### Preprocessing & Augmentation

A single `transforms.Compose` pipeline is applied to every split:

```python
T.Compose([
    T.Resize((224, 224)),               # standardize spatial dimensions for ResNet
    T.RandomRotation(degrees=(-20, 20)),# light augmentation — signatures vary in tilt
    T.ToTensor(),                        # scale pixels to [0, 1]
    T.Normalize(
        mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],     # ImageNet channel means
        std =[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]      # ImageNet channel stds
    ),
])
```

ImageNet statistics are reused because the backbone was pretrained on ImageNet — keeping the same normalization preserves the feature distribution the backbone learned.

---

### Data Splitting

`torch.utils.data.random_split` splits the full dataset at a fixed ratio with no manual seed, so each run produces a different random partition:

```python
train_count = int(0.6 * total_count)   # 505
valid_count = int(0.3 * total_count)   # 252
test_count  = total_count - train_count - valid_count  # 85
```

---

### DataLoaders

```python
trainloader      = DataLoader(train_data, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
validationloader = DataLoader(val_data,   batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
testloader       = DataLoader(test_data,  batch_size=32, shuffle=False)
```

| Loader | Batches | Samples |
|---|---|---|
| Train | 16 | 505 |
| Validation | 8 | 252 |
| Test | 3 | 85 |

---

### Model Architecture

ResNet-34 with a custom classification head replacing the original 1000-class fully-connected layer:

```
ResNet-34 (pretrained backbone)
    └── avgpool: AdaptiveAvgPool2d → (1, 1)
    └── fc (replaced):
            Dropout(p=0.1)
            Linear(in_features=512, out_features=2)
```

The backbone feature extractor is **not frozen** — all layers are updated during fine-tuning.

---

### Training

| Hyperparameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Loss function | `CrossEntropyLoss` |
| Optimizer | `SGD` |
| Learning rate | `1e-3` |
| Momentum | `0.9` |
| Epochs | `5` |
| Batch size | `32` |
| Device | CPU (CUDA not available in this run) |

Training loop summary — loss decreases steadily across epochs:

| Epoch | Train Loss | Val Loss |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.0231 | 0.0205 |
| 2 | 0.0189 | 0.0201 |
| 3 | 0.0160 | 0.0159 |
| 4 | 0.0132 | 0.0153 |
| 5 | 0.0103 | 0.0099 |

Total training time on CPU: ~27 minutes.

The `train_model` function runs one full epoch: forward pass → loss → backward pass → optimizer step over the training batches, then a no-grad pass over the validation batches to compute validation loss.

---

### Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on the held-out test set:

```
Test Loss: 0.0032
```

The `evaluation` function mirrors the validation pass in `train_model` but runs over `testloader` and does not update weights.

---

### Inference

Single-image prediction pipeline:

```python
image = Image.open("path/to/signature.png")

preprocess = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.Grayscale(3),    # ensure 3-channel input even for grayscale images
    transforms.ToTensor()
])

image = preprocess(image)[:3]           # drop alpha channel if present
image = image.unsqueeze(0).to(device)   # add batch dimension

with torch.no_grad():
    logits    = model(image)
    probs     = torch.softmax(logits, dim=1)
    pred_label = torch.argmax(probs, dim=1)

predicted_class = data.classes[pred_label.item()]  # 'Forged' or 'Original'
```

Example output for `dataset/Original/00101001.png`:

```
Predicted Label: 1
Predicted Label Names: Original
```

---

### Saving & Loading the Model

The full model object (architecture + weights) is persisted with `torch.save`:

```python
# Save
torch.save(model, 'saved-model/model.pt')

# Load
model = torch.load('saved-model/model.pt', weights_only=False)
model.eval()
```

`weights_only=False` is required because the file contains the full model object, not just a state dict.

---

---

## Part 2 — Production Pipeline

**Entry point:** `main.py`

This part wraps the trained model in a modular, production-style pipeline. Each concern (data ingestion, configuration, logging, error handling) lives in its own module under `src/`.

---

### Data Injection

**File:** `src/components/data_injection.py`

`DataInjection` handles three steps in sequence:

1. **Download** — calls `GCloudSync.sync_file_from_gcloud` to pull `dataset.zip` from GCloud Storage into the artifacts directory via `gsutil cp`
2. **Unzip** — extracts the zip into the same artifacts directory using `ZipFile`
3. **Cleanup** — deletes the zip file after extraction

Returns a `DataInjectionArtifacts` instance pointing to the extracted dataset directory.

**GCloud sync** uses `subprocess.run(check=True)` with the full resolved path to `gsutil` (resolved via `shutil.which` with fallback to `~/google-cloud-sdk/bin/gsutil`) to avoid PATH issues in subprocess environments.

---

### Data Transformation

**File:** `src/components/data_transformation.py`

`DataTransformation` prepares the dataset for training in three steps:

1. **Transform** — builds a `transforms.Compose` pipeline (resize → random rotation → to tensor → normalize with ImageNet stats)
2. **Split** — uses `torch.utils.data.random_split` to divide the full dataset into train, validation, and test subsets using the configured ratios
3. **Save** — serializes each split to disk as a `.pkl` file using `dill`

Returns a `DataTransformationArtifacts` instance with paths to the three serialized splits and the number of classes.

---

### Model Trainer

**File:** `src/components/model_trainer.py`

`ModelTrainer` fine-tunes a pretrained ResNet-34 for signature classification:

1. **Load** — deserializes the train and validation splits from disk and wraps them in `DataLoader`s
2. **Build model** — loads `ResNet34_Weights.DEFAULT` and replaces the final FC layer with `Dropout(0.1) → Linear(512, num_classes)`
3. **Train** — runs SGD with momentum over the configured number of epochs; logs train and validation loss per epoch
4. **Save** — persists the full model object to `model.pt` using `torch.save`

Training loop per epoch:

```
forward → CrossEntropyLoss → backward → optimizer.step   (train)
no_grad forward → CrossEntropyLoss                        (validation)
```

Loss is averaged over the number of batches (not samples) and printed each epoch:
```
Epoch 1 / 5
Train loss: 0.6821  Test loss: 0.5934
```

Returns a `ModelTrainerArtifacts` instance with the path to the saved model.

---

### Model Evaluation

**File:** `src/components/model_evaluation.py`

`ModelEvaluation` compares the newly trained model against the current best model stored in GCloud Storage:

1. **Fetch best model** — downloads `model.pt` from the configured GCloud bucket into `BEST_MODEL_DIR`; if no model exists yet (first run), the download is skipped gracefully
2. **Evaluate trained model** — loads the freshly trained model and runs a no-grad forward pass over the test dataloader, computing average `CrossEntropyLoss`
3. **Compare** — if no prior best model is present, the new model is accepted automatically; otherwise the best model is also evaluated and the one with lower test loss wins
4. **Return** — produces a `ModelEvaluationArtifacts` with `is_model_accepted = True/False`

The pipeline aborts in `run_pipeline()` if `is_model_accepted` is `False`, preventing a worse model from being pushed.

---

### Model Pusher

**File:** `src/components/model_pusher.py`

`ModelPusher` uploads the accepted trained model to GCloud Storage so it becomes the new best model for future evaluation runs:

1. **Upload** — calls `GCloudSync.sync_file_to_gscloud` to push the `trained_model_path` from `ModelTrainerArtifacts` to the configured bucket
2. **Return** — produces a `ModelPusherArtifacts` with the target bucket name

Only runs when `ModelEvaluationArtifacts.is_model_accepted` is `True`.

---

### Training Pipeline

**File:** `src/pipeline/training.py`

`TrainingPipeline` is the top-level orchestrator. `run_pipeline()` calls each stage in order and stores its artifact on `self`:

```python
tracking_pipeline = TrainingPipeline()
tracking_pipeline.run_pipeline()
```

Stages completed so far:

| Stage | Method | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Data Injection | `start_data_injection()` | Done |
| Data Transformation | `start_data_transformation()` | Done |
| Model Trainer | `start_model_trainer()` | Done |
| Model Evaluation | `start_model_evaluation()` | Done |
| Model Pusher | `start_model_pusher()` | Done |

`run_pipeline()` gates the push stage on evaluation: if the trained model performs worse than the current best model in GCloud Storage, the pipeline raises an exception and skips the push.

---

### Logger

**File:** `src/logger/__init__.py`

Writes structured log lines to both a timestamped file and stdout:

```
[2026-05-14 23:15:21,115] root - INFO - <message>
```

Log files are written to `logs/<timestamp>.log`.

---

### Exception Handler

**File:** `src/exceptions/__init__.py`

`CustomException` enriches every exception with the source file name and line number:

```
Error occurred python script name [<file>] line number [<line>] error message [<msg>]
```

Usage throughout the codebase:
```python
except Exception as e:
    raise CustomException(e, sys) from e
```

---
